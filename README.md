This project predicts housing prices in California using a linear regression model enhanced with polynomial feature scaling to capture nonlinear relationships. The model is trained on the California Housing dataset provided by sklearn, utilizing features such as Median Income, House Age, Average Rooms, Average Bedrooms, Population, Average Occupancy, Latitude, and Longitude. After preprocessing and model training, a simple Flask web application was developed to make the model interactive and accessible via a local host, allowing users to input feature values and get real-time price predictions locally initally.
